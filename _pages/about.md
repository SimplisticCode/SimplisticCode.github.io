Dear visitor,

I am a PhD student at the Department of Engineering, Aarhus University, Denmark. 
My research interests lie in the intersection of co-simulation, machine learning and formal methods.
My doctoral research is focused on developing methods for co-simulation of cyber-physical systems using formal methods to ensure correctness of the simulation results.
The research track is supervised by [Professor Stefan Hallerstede](http://olewinther.info/) and [Dr. Claudio Gomes](http://hansenlab.org/).

Outside of research, I enjoy challenging myself both mentally and physically.
I am a former elite orienteerer and have represented Denmark at the Junior World Orienteering Championships.
I am now spending my experience as a coach in the local orienteering club OK Pan Ã…rhus and as a volunteer for the danish national team.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments on my research or if you are interested in a collaboration.
